# # Batch Training with Ray Data

# **Batch training** and tuning are common tasks in simple machine learning use-cases such as time series forecasting. They require fitting of simple models on data batches corresponding to different locations, products, etc. Batch training can take less time to process all the data at once, but only if those batches can run in parallel!
# 
# This notebook showcases how to conduct batch training regression algorithms from [XGBoost](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/examples/tune-xgboost.html) and [Scikit-learn](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-more-libs/joblib.html) with **[Ray Data](data)**. **XGBoost** is a popular open-source library used for regression and classification. **Scikit-learn** is a popular open-source library with a vast assortment of well-known ML algorithms.
# 
# ```{tip}
# The workload showcased in this notebook can be expressed using different Ray components, such as Ray Data, Ray Tune and Ray Core.
# For more information, including best practices, see {ref}`ref-use-cases-mmt`.
# ```
# 
# ![Batch training diagram](../../data/examples/images/batch-training.svg)
# 
# For the data, we will use the [NYC Taxi dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). This popular tabular dataset contains historical taxi pickups by timestamp and location in NYC.
# 
# For the training, we will train separate regression models to predict `trip_duration`, with a different model for each dropoff location in NYC. Specifically, we will conduct an experiment for each `dropoff_location_id`, to find the best either XGBoost or Scikit-learn model, per location.

# ```
# 
# [Ray Data](data) is the standard way to load and exchange data in Ray libraries and applications. We will use the [Ray Data APIs](data-api) to read the data and quickly inspect it.

# ### Filtering a Dataset on Read <a class="anchor" id="filter_ds"></a>
# 
# Normally there is some last-mile data processing required before training. Let's just assume we know the data processing steps are:
# - Drop negative trip distances, 0 fares, 0 passengers.
# - Drop 2 unknown zones: `['264', '265']`.
# - Calculate trip duration and add it as a new column.
# - Drop trip durations smaller than 1 minute and greater than 24 hours.
# 
# Instead of blindly reading all the data, it would be better if we only read the data we needed. This is similar concept to SQL `SELECT only rows, columns you need` vs `SELECT *`.
# 
# ```{tip}
# Best practice is to filter as much as you can directly in the Dataset `read_parquet()`.
# ```
# 
# Note that Ray Data' Parquet reader supports projection (column selection) and row filter pushdown, where we can push the above column selection and the row-based filter to the Parquet read. If we specify column selection at Parquet read time, the unselected columns won't even be read from disk. This can save a lot of memory, especially with big datasets, and allow us to avoid OOM issues.
# 
# The row-based filter is specified via [Arrow's dataset field expressions](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/6.0/python/generated/pyarrow.dataset.Expression.html#pyarrow.dataset.Expression). 
# 

# In[7]:


def pushdown_read_data(files_list: list, sample_ids: list) -> Dataset:
    start = time.time()

    filter_expr = (
        (pds.field("passenger_count") > 0)
        & (pds.field("trip_distance") > 0)
        & (pds.field("fare_amount") > 0)
        & (~pds.field("pickup_location_id").isin([264, 265]))
        & (~pds.field("dropoff_location_id").isin([264, 265]))
        & (pds.field("dropoff_location_id").isin(sample_ids))
    )

    dataset = ray.data.read_parquet(
        files_list,
        columns=[
            "pickup_at",
            "dropoff_at",
            "pickup_location_id",
            "dropoff_location_id",

    return dataset

ds_raw = pushdown_read_data(s3_files, sample_locations)


# ### Inspecting a Dataset <a class="anchor" id="inspect_ds"></a>
# 
# Let's get some basic statistics about our newly created Dataset.
# 
# As our Dataset is backed by Parquet, we can obtain the number of rows from the metadata without triggering a full data read.
# 

# In[9]:


print(f"Number of rows: {ds_raw.count()}")


# Similarly, we can obtain the Dataset size (in bytes) from the metadata.
# 

# In[10]:


print(f"Size bytes (from parquet metadata): {ds_raw.size_bytes()}")


# 
# Let's fetch and inspect the schema of the underlying Parquet files.

# In[11]:


print("\nSchema data types:")
data_types = list(zip(ds_raw.schema().names, ds_raw.schema().types))
for s in data_types:
    print(f"{s[0]}: {s[1]}")


# ### Transforming a Dataset in parallel using custom functions <a class="anchor" id="transform_ds"></a>
# 
# Ray Data allows you to specify custom data transform functions. These [user defined functions (UDFs)](transforming_data) can be called using `Dataset.map_batches(my_function)`. The transformation will be conducted in parallel for each data batch.
# 
# ```{tip}
# You may need to call `Dataset.repartition(n)` first to split the Dataset into more blocks internally. By default, each block corresponds to one file. The upper bound of parallelism is the number of blocks.
# ```
# 
# You can specify the data format you are using in the `batch_format` parameter. The dataset will be divided into batches and those batches converted into the specified format. Available data formats you can specify in the `batch_format` paramater include `"pandas", "pyarrow", "numpy"`. Tabular data will be passed into your UDF by default as a pandas DataFrame. Tensor data will be passed into your UDF as a numpy array.
# 
# Here, we will use `batch_format="pandas"` explicitly for clarity.

# In[12]:


# A pandas DataFrame UDF for transforming the Dataset in parallel.
def transform_df(input_df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df = input_df.copy()

    # calculate trip_duration
    df["trip_duration"] = (df["dropoff_at"] - df["pickup_at"]).dt.seconds
    # filter trip_durations > 1 minute and less than 24 hours
    df = df[df["trip_duration"] > 60]
    df = df[df["trip_duration"] < 24 * 60 * 60]
    # keep only necessary columns
    df.drop(
        ["dropoff_at", "pickup_at", "pickup_location_id", "fare_amount"],
        axis=1,
        inplace=True,
    )
    df["dropoff_location_id"] = df["dropoff_location_id"].fillna(-1)
    return df


# In[13]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('time', '', '\n# Test the transform UDF.\nprint(f"Number of rows before transformation: {ds_raw.count()}")\n\n# Repartition the dataset to allow for higher parallelism.\n# Best practice: repartition to all available cpu except a few, with a cap\nnum_partitions = min(num_cpu - 2, 32)\nds = ds_raw.repartition(num_partitions)\n\n# .map_batches applies a UDF to each partition of the data in parallel.\nds = ds.map_batches(transform_df, batch_format="pandas")\n\n# Verify row count.\nprint(f"Number of rows after transformation: {ds.count()}")\n')


# ## Batch training with Ray Data <a class="anchor" id="batch_train_ds"></a>

# Now that we have learned more about our data and written a pandas UDF to transform our data, we are ready to train a model on batches of this data in parallel.
# 
# 1. We will use the `dropoff_location_id` column in the dataset to group the dataset into data batches. 
# 2. Then we will fit a separate model for each batch to predict `trip_duration`.

# In[14]:


# import standard sklearn libraries

# set global random seed for sklearn models
np.random.seed(415)


# ### Define search space for training
# 
# In this notebook, we will run parallel training jobs per data batch, drop-off location. The training jobs will be defined using a search space and simple grid search. Depending on your need, fancier search spaces and search algorithms are possible with [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/tune/tutorials/tune-search-spaces.html#tune-search-space-tutorial).
# 
# **Below, we define our search space consists of:**
# 
# - Different algorithms, either:
#   - Linear Regression or XGBoost Tree Regression.
#   
# We want to train using every algorithm in the search space. What this means is every algorithm will be applied to every NYC Taxi drop-off location.

# In[15]:


ALGORITHMS = [
    LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True),
    xgb.XGBRegressor(max_depth=4),
]


# ### Define training functions
# 
# We want to fit a linear regression model to the trip duration for each drop-off location. For scoring, we will calculate mean absolute error on the validation set, and report that as model error per drop-off location.
# 
# The `fit_and_score_sklearn` function contains the logic necessary to fit a scikit-learn model and evaluate it using mean absolute error.

# In[16]:


def fit_and_score_sklearn(
    train_df: pd.DataFrame, test_df: pd.DataFrame, model: BaseEstimator
) -> pd.DataFrame:

    # Assemble train/test pandas dfs
    train_X = train_df[["passenger_count", "trip_distance"]]
    train_y = train_df[TARGET]
    test_X = test_df[["passenger_count", "trip_distance"]]
    test_y = test_df[TARGET]

    # Start training.
    model = model.fit(train_X, train_y)
    pred_y = model.predict(test_X)

    # Evaluate.
    error = sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error(test_y, pred_y)
    if error is None:
        error = 10000.0

    # Assemble return as a pandas dataframe.
    return_df = pd.DataFrame({"model": [model], "error": [error]})

    # return model, error
    return return_df


# The `train_and_evaluate` function contains the logic for train-test splitting and fitting of a model using the `fit_and_score_sklearn` function.
# 
# As an input, this function takes in a pandas DataFrame. When we call `Dataset.map_batches` or `Dataset.groupby().map_groups()`, the Dataset will be batched into multiple pandas DataFrames and this function will run for each batch in parallel. We will return the model and its error. Those results will be collected back into a Dataset.

# In[17]:


def train_and_evaluate(
    df: pd.DataFrame, models: List[BaseEstimator], location_id: int

# Recall how we wrote a data transform `transform_batch` UDF? It was called with pattern:
# - `Dataset.map_batches(transform_batch, batch_format="pandas")`
# 
# Similarly, we can write a custom groupy-aggregate function `agg_func` which will run for each [Dataset *group-by*](transforming_groupby) group in parallel. The usage pattern is:
# - `Dataset.groupby(column).map_groups(agg_func, batch_format="pandas")`.

# ### Run batch training using `map_groups`
# 
# The main "driver code" reads each Parquet file (where each file corresponds to one month of NYC taxi data) into a Dataset `ds`. 
# 
# Then we use Dataset *group-by* to map each group into a batch of data and run `agg_func` on each grouping in parallel by calling `ds.groupby("dropoff_location_id").map_groups(agg_func, batch_format="pandas")`.
