# # GPT-J-6B Fine-Tuning with Ray Train and DeepSpeed
# 
# This example showcases how to use Ray Train for **GPT-J fine-tuning**. GPT-J is a GPT-2-like causal language model trained on the Pile dataset. This particular model has 6 billion parameters. For more information, see [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gptj).
# 
# This example uses the Ray Train ðŸ¤— Transformers integration and a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Hub. Note that this example is adaptable to other similar models.
# 
# This is an advanced example that focuses on the performance and distributed computing aspects of Ray Train. For a beginner-friendly introduction to the Ray Train ðŸ¤— Transformers integration, see {ref}`Basic Example for HuggingFace Transformers <transformers_torch_trainer_basic_example>`.
# 
# Read [Ray Train Key Concepts](train-key-concepts) and [Ray Data Integration User Guides](data-ingest-torch) before starting this example.
# 
# ```{note}
# To run this example, make sure your Ray cluster has access to at least one GPU with 16 or more GBs of memory. The required amount of memory depends on the model. This notebook is tested with 16 g4dn.4xlarge instances (including the head node). To use a CPU head node, turn on [cloud checkpointing](tune-cloud-checkpointing) to avoid OOM errors that may happen due to the default behavior of syncing the checkpoint files to the head node.
# ```
# 
# This notebook has the following steps:
# 1. [Set up Ray](#setup)
# 2. [Load the dataset](#load)
# 3. [Preprocess the dataset with Ray Data](#preprocess)
# 4. [Run the training with Ray Train](#train)
# 5. [Generate text from prompt](#predict)

# ### Fine-tuning the model with Ray Train <a name="train"></a>
# 
# Configure Ray Train's {class}`~ray.train.torch.TorchTrainer` to perform distributed fine-tuning of the model. Specify a `train_loop_per_worker` function, which defines the training logic to be distributed by Ray using Distributed Data Parallelism, which uses the PyTorch Distributed backend internally. Each worker has its own copy of the model, but operates on different data. At the end of each step, all the workers sync gradients.
# 
# Because GPT-J is a relatively large model, it may not be possible to fit it on smaller GPU types (<=16 GB GRAM). To deal with that issue, this example uses [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed), a library to optimize the training process and to offload and partition optimizer and parameter states, reducing GRAM usage. Furthermore, DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3 can load large models without running out of memory.
# 
# ðŸ¤— Transformers and Ray Train's {ref}`integrations <train-transformers-integration>` allow you to easily configure and use DDP and DeepSpeed. All you need to do is specify the DeepSpeed configuration in the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) object.
# 
# ```{tip}
# There are many DeepSpeed settings that allow you to trade-off speed for memory usage. The settings used below are tailored to the cluster setup used (16 g4dn.4xlarge nodes) and per device batch size of 16. Some things to keep in mind:
# - If your GPUs support bfloat16, use that instead of float16 mixed precision to get better performance and prevent overflows. Replace `fp16=True` with `bf16=True` in `TrainingArguments`.
# - If you are running out of GRAM: try reducing batch size (defined in the cell below the next one), set `"overlap_comm": False` in DeepSpeed config.
# - If you are running out of RAM, add more nodes to your cluster, use nodes with more RAM, set `"pin_memory": False` in the DeepSpeed config, reduce the batch size, and remove `"offload_param"` from the DeepSpeed config.
# 
# For more information on DeepSpeed configuration, refer to [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/deepspeed) and [DeepSpeed documentation](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/).
# 
# Additionally, if you prefer a lower-level API, the logic below can be expressed as an [Accelerate training loop](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/blob/main/examples/by_feature/deepspeed_with_config_support.py) distributed by a Ray Train {class}`~ray.train.torch.torch_trainer.TorchTrainer`.
# ```
# 
# #### Training speed
# 
# As this example uses data parallelism, each worker operates on its own shard of the data. The batch size set in `train_ds.iter_torch_batches` is the **per device batch size** (per worker batch size). By changing the number of workers, you can change the **effective batch size** and thus the time needed for training to complete. Calculate the effective batch size as `per device batch size * number of workers * number of gradient accumulation steps`. As you add more workers, the effective batch size rises and thus less time is needed to complete a full epoch. While the speedup is not exactly linear due to extra communication overheads, in many cases it can be close to linear.
# 
# The preprocessed dataset has 1348 examples. We have set per device batch size to 16.
# 
# * With 16 g4dn.4xlarge nodes, the effective batch size was 256, which equals to 85 steps per epoch. One epoch took **~2440 seconds** (including initialization time).
# 
# * With 32 g4dn.4xlarge nodes, the effective batch size was 512, which equals to 43 steps per epoch. One epoch took **~1280 seconds** (including initialization time).
